This folder contains plots of the results of the sensitivity analysis on the baseline simulation presented in the thesis.
These figures plot the tables which are given in the file "sensitivitytables", i.e. they show the mean deviation from the baseline,
as well as the variance of key variables as parameters of the model are varied.
The files are named according to the format "parameter"-"measure". Thus, for instance, "phi-var" shows how the variance of some model
variables changes as the parameter phi is altered.
In the case of the figures showing variances, the dotted red line appearing in each graph shows the variance of the respective variable
in the baseline simulation while in the figures showing mean deviations, the dotted red line is at 0.
