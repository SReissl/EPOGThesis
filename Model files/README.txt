This folder contains the two model files necessary to reproduce the baseline simulation and the bank heterogeneity experiment reported in the thesis. 
Both files contain all model equations as well as initial values and parameters and can be fed directly into the PKSFC package available at https://github.com/S120/PKSFC.
In addition, the folder also contains an RMD file containing all model equations and a more detailed model outline than is given in the thesis itself.
